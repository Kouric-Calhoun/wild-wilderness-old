      <p>Identifying edible plants can be tricky, as many toxic species have similar 
      characteristics as non-toxic ones. But there are a few easily identifiable 
      plants growing rampantly across the country that are not only nutrient-dense 
      but also delicious, including stinging nettle, dandelion, lamb’s quarters, 
      and miner’s lettuce.
